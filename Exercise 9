# Exercise 9: Create a new list from two list using the following condition
# Given two list of numbers, write a program to create a new list such that the new list should
# contain odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

odd_numbers = [num for num in list1 if num % 2 != 0]
even_numbers = [num for num in list2 if num % 2 == 0]
new_list = odd_numbers + even_numbers
print("New list:", new_list)
