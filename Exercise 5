# Exercise 5: Check if the first and last number of a list is the same.
# Write a program to print “First and Last Numbers are same” if the first and last numbers of a
# given list are the same. If the numbers are different then print “Not Same”.

list = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
if list[0] == list[-1]:
    print("same")
else:
    print("not same")
